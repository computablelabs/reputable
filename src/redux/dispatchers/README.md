#Dispatchers

These are essentially "bound action creators" that we use, along with the `subscriber.ts`, to create
a functioning redux state machine outside of a larger framework like React/Connect etc...

Useful for specs, or implementations where you are using a stand-alone, minimalist, templating/virtual-dom solution
like Hyper or lit-html
